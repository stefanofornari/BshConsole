help()
------

This command shows help text accordingly to the following rules.

Given a root directory pointed by the beanshell variable bshell.help, each
files with extension .txt represents a command help. help() walks through the
directory tree looking for files with extension .txt and outputs its content
on the console. Before printing the content of the file, help() prints the name
of the command derived from the path of the help file stripping out of the .txt
extension and turning the parent directory into a package name with the usual
Java convention. Files with extension other than .txt are ignored.

For example, given bshell.help set to /opt/bshell/help and the following
directory structure:

/opt
    /bshell
           /help
                hello.txt
                ignore.me
                /bshell
                    /commands
                             cls.txt
                             help.txt

help() shows an output similar to:


    hello
    =====

    {content of help/hello.txt}

    bshell.commands.cls
    ===================

    {content of help/bshell/commands/cls.txt}

    bshell.commands.help
    ====================

    {content of help/bshell/commands/help.txt}


help(name)
----------

A variation of the help() that displays all help files named {name}.txt
(regardless the subdir they are in).

For example, given bshell.help set to /opt/bshell/help and the following
directory structure

/opt
    /bshell
           /help
                hello.txt
                /bshell
                    /commands
                             cls.txt
                             help.txt
                /com
                    /acme
                         hello.txt

help("cls") shows:

    bshell.commands.cls
    ===================

    {content of help/bshell/commands/cls.txt}

help("hello") shows:

    hello
    =====

    {content of help/hello.txt}

    com.acme.hello
    ==============

    {content of help/com/acme/hello.txt}
